# Graceful Failure for Malformed Files

This feature ensures that one bad memory file does not prevent other valid files from being processed.

## Instructions

1.  Wrap the file processing logic in a try/catch block.
2.  If an error occurs while parsing or indexing a specific file, log the error and then continue to the next file.
3.  The overall indexing process should not halt due to a single file's failure.
4.  The invalid file should be skipped and not included in the memory index.
