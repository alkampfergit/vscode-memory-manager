# Error Reporting Mechanisms

This feature integrates multiple VS Code UI components to provide comprehensive error reporting.

## Instructions

1.  **Output Channel**: Create a dedicated `vscode.OutputChannel` for the extension (e.g., "Memory Manager"). Log detailed error messages and diagnostic information here.
2.  **Status Bar**: Create a `vscode.StatusBarItem` to provide a high-level status of the memory system. It could show the number of indexed memories or an error icon if issues are present.
3.  **Problems Panel**: Use a `vscode.DiagnosticCollection` to report file-specific errors. This will underline the error in the editor and list it in the Problems panel.
