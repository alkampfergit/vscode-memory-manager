# User-Friendly Feedback

This feature focuses on making error messages clear, concise, and actionable for the user.

## Instructions

1.  When creating diagnostic messages for the Problems Panel, make the message easy to understand. For example, "YAML frontmatter is missing the required 'tags' field."
2.  For errors logged to the Output Channel, provide enough context for debugging, including the file path and a stack trace if applicable.
3.  When the Status Bar item indicates an error, set its `tooltip` property to a summary of the problem (e.g., "3 memory files failed to parse. Check the Output Channel for details.").
