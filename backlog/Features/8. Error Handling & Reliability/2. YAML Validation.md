# YAML Frontmatter Validation

This feature implements robust validation for YAML frontmatter and reports errors clearly.

## Instructions

1.  When parsing a memory file, if the YAML frontmatter is invalid (e.g., malformed, or missing `title` or `tags`), log a detailed error.
2.  The error message should include the file path and a clear description of what is wrong.
3.  The file should be excluded from the memory index until it is fixed.
4.  Use the Problems Panel (`vscode.Diagnostic`) to show the error directly on the file in the editor.
