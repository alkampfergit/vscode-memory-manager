# Non-Intrusive Error Handling

This feature establishes a strategy for handling errors in a way that does not interrupt the user's workflow.

## Instructions

1.  Never use modal dialogs (`vscode.window.showErrorMessage` with `modal: true`) for validation or parsing errors.
2.  All errors related to file parsing or indexing should fail silently from the user's immediate perspective.
3.  Use designated, non-blocking UI surfaces like the Output Channel, Status Bar, and Problems Panel to report issues.
