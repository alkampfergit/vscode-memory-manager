# Link Resolution System

This feature implements the system for resolving parsed links and retrieving the content of the referenced files.

## Instructions

1.  Create a `LinkResolutionService`.
2.  This service will take the base path of the memory file and a list of parsed links as input.
3.  For each link, resolve the absolute path of the referenced file.
4.  Read the content of the referenced file from the disk.
5.  The service should return a map where keys are the original link paths and values are the content of the referenced files.
6.  This system should only resolve one level deep; it should not recursively resolve links found in the referenced content.
