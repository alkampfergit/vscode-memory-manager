# Content Processing: Link Transformation

This feature updates the content injection engine to handle the transformation of Markdown links.

## Instructions

1.  Modify the `ContentInjectionEngine`.
2.  After retrieving the base content of a memory file, use the `MarkdownLinkParser` to find all links.
3.  Use the `LinkResolutionService` to get the content of all linked files.
4.  For each link in the base content, replace the full link syntax (e.g., `[text](path)`) with just the link's text (`text`).
5.  Append the content of all resolved linked files to the end of the processed base content.
6.  Ensure there is a clear separation (e.g., a newline) between the base content and the appended content.
