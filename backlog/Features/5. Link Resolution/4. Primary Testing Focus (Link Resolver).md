# Primary Testing Focus (Link Resolver)

This feature focuses on creating thorough tests for the link parsing and resolution logic.

## Instructions

1.  Write unit tests for the `MarkdownLinkParser`. Test various link formats, including relative and absolute paths.
2.  Write integration tests for the `LinkResolutionService`.
3.  Simulate resolving links to existing files and verify the content is read correctly.
4.  Test the behavior for links pointing to non-existent files, ensuring it fails gracefully (e.g., returns null or an empty string).
5.  Test the end-to-end content processing, verifying that a memory file's content is correctly transformed with its linked content appended.
