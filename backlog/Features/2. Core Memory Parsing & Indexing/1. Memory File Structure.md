# Memory File Structure Definition

This feature defines the standard structure for memory files, including YAML frontmatter and Markdown content.

## Instructions

1.  Document the mandatory `title` and `tags` fields for the YAML frontmatter.
2.  Document optional metadata fields like `priority`, `created`, and `updated`.
3.  Provide a clear example of a well-structured memory file in the project's documentation.
