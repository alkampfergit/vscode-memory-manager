# In-Memory Index Cache âœ…

This feature creates an in-memory cache to store parsed memory file data for fast retrieval.

**Status:** Completed - Implemented in [MemoryIndex.ts](../../../src/core/MemoryIndex.ts)

## Instructions

1.  Design a data structure (e.g., a Map or a plain object) to hold the indexed memory files. The key should be the file path.
2.  The stored value for each file should include its parsed frontmatter, content, and any other relevant metadata.
3.  Implement a class or module that manages this cache (e.g., `MemoryIndex`).
4.  Provide methods to add, update, and remove entries from the cache.
5.  Provide a method to retrieve a memory item by its file path.
