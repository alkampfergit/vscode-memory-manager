# Primary Testing Focus (File Parser) âœ…

This feature emphasizes the creation of robust tests for the file parsing and validation logic.

**Status:** Completed - Tests in [tests/core/](../../../tests/core/)

## Instructions

1.  Write unit tests for the YAML Frontmatter Parser.
2.  Test with valid frontmatter, ensuring correct extraction of metadata and content.
3.  Test with invalid frontmatter (e.g., missing `title`, missing `tags`), ensuring errors are handled gracefully.
4.  Test with malformed YAML, ensuring the parser doesn't crash and reports an error.
5.  Test files with no frontmatter, ensuring they are processed correctly (e.g., ignored).
