# YAML Frontmatter Parser âœ…

This feature implements a parser to extract and validate the YAML frontmatter from memory files.

**Status:** Completed - Implemented in [MemoryFileParser.ts](../../../src/core/MemoryFileParser.ts)

## Instructions

1.  Choose and install a library for parsing YAML content (e.g., `js-yaml`).
2.  Implement a function that takes a file's content as a string.
3.  The function should identify and extract the YAML block from the top of the file.
4.  Parse the extracted YAML string into a JavaScript object.
5.  Validate the parsed object to ensure it contains the mandatory `title` and `tags` fields.
6.  Return the parsed metadata and the remaining Markdown content separately.
