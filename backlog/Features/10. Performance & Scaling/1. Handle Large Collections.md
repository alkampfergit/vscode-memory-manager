# Handle Large Memory Collections

This feature ensures the extension performs well even with a large number of memory files.

## Instructions

1.  When indexing, process files one by one rather than reading all of them into memory at once.
2.  Ensure the data structures used for the in-memory index are efficient for lookups (e.g., using Maps over Arrays for key-based access).
3.  Benchmark the indexing process with a large number of files (e.g., 1000+) to identify any performance bottlenecks.
4.  There should be no artificial limits on the number of files that can be indexed.
