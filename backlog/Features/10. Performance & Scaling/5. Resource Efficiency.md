# Resource Efficiency

This feature focuses on keeping the extension's memory and CPU usage as low as possible.

## Instructions

1.  Profile the extension's memory usage during indexing and idle states.
2.  Ensure that references to large objects or data structures are properly released when they are no longer needed to avoid memory leaks.
3.  Lazy loading should be the default strategy: only compute or load data when it is required. For example, the hierarchical tag tree is only needed for tag completion, so its generation could be deferred until then.
