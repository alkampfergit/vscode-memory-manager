# Immediate File Change Processing

This feature ensures that file changes are reflected in the memory index in real-time without any delay.

## Instructions

1.  The file watcher event handlers should process file changes immediately upon being triggered.
2.  Do not use a debouncing mechanism, as the goal is maximum responsiveness for a user editing their memory files.
3.  The file processing itself should be fast enough that immediate execution does not cause performance issues.
