# On-demand Link Resolution

This feature ensures that the content of linked files is only loaded when it is actually needed.

## Instructions

1.  Confirm that the link resolution and content loading process is only triggered during the execution of a `#memory-tag` command.
2.  Do not pre-emptively load the content of linked files during the initial indexing phase.
3.  The in-memory index should only store the content of the primary memory files, not the content of files they link to. This keeps the initial memory footprint low.
