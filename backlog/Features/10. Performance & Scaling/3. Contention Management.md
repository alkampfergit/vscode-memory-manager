# Queue-based Contention Management

This feature prevents race conditions and ensures file system events are processed in an orderly manner.

## Instructions

1.  Implement a simple asynchronous queue for processing file change events.
2.  When a file watcher event is received, add a task to the queue with the relevant file path.
3.  A single worker process should consume tasks from the queue one at a time.
4.  This ensures that if many file events arrive in a short burst, they are processed sequentially, preventing issues like trying to read a file that is simultaneously being written to.
