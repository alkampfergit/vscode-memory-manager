# Memory Health Status Indicator

This feature provides a real-time, at-a-glance indicator of the memory system's health.

## Instructions

1.  Use the `vscode.StatusBarItem` created for error reporting.
2.  When the system is healthy (all files parsed successfully), the status bar should show a positive status (e.g., a checkmark icon and the number of indexed memories).
3.  When there are parsing or indexing errors, the status bar should change to an error state (e.g., a warning or error icon).
4.  The tooltip of the status bar item should provide more details, especially in an error state.
5.  The status bar item should be updated whenever the memory index changes or an error occurs.
