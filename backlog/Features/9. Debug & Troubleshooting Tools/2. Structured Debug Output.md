# Structured Debug Output

This feature implements a structured logging system for easier debugging and troubleshooting.

## Instructions

1.  Create a simple logger class or module.
2.  The logger should prefix messages with a level (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR) and a timestamp.
3.  Use this logger throughout the application instead of `console.log`.
4.  All log output should be directed to the extension's dedicated Output Channel.
5.  When logging complex objects, use `JSON.stringify` with indentation for readability.
