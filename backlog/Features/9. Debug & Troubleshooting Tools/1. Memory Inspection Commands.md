# Memory Inspection Commands

This feature provides VS Code commands for users to inspect the current state of the memory index.

## Instructions

1.  Register a command `memory-manager.showAllTags`. When run, it should display the hierarchical tag structure and the count of files per tag in a new document or the output channel.
2.  Register a command `memory-manager.showMemoryContents`. This command should display the full parsed content of the memory index, including file paths and metadata, in a structured format (like JSON).
3.  Register a command `memory-manager.rebuildMemoryIndex`. This command will manually trigger a full re-scan and re-indexing of the `Memory/` folder.
