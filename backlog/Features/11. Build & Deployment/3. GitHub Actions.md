# GitHub Actions for CI/CD

This feature sets up an automated pipeline on GitHub Actions to build and test the extension on every push.

## Instructions

1.  Create a `.github/workflows` directory in the project root.
2.  Create a new workflow YAML file (e.g., `ci.yml`).
3.  Configure the workflow to trigger on pushes to the `master` branch and on pull requests.
4.  The workflow jobs should:
    a. Check out the code.
    b. Set up a Node.js environment.
    c. Install npm dependencies (`npm ci`).
    d. Run the linter (`npm run lint`).
    e. Run the tests (`npm test`).
    f. Run the build script (`npm run build`) to generate the `.vsix` file.
5.  (Optional) Configure the workflow to upload the generated `.vsix` file as a build artifact.
