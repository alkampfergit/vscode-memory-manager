# Manual VSIX Distribution

This feature defines the process for distributing the extension manually via a `.vsix` file.

## Instructions

1.  The primary output of the build process will be a `.vsix` file.
2.  Document the process for installing a `.vsix` file in VS Code for users and testers.
3.  This involves using the "Install from VSIX..." command in the Extensions view in VS Code.
4.  Initially, the extension will not be published to the VS Code Marketplace.
