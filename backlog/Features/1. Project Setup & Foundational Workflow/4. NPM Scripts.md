# NPM Scripts

This feature defines a set of npm scripts to streamline common development, testing, and build tasks.

## Instructions

1.  Add a `lint` script to `package.json` to run ESLint across the codebase.
2.  Add a `compile` script to run the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`).
3.  Add a `build` script that combines linting and compiling for a full project build.
4.  Add a `test` script to execute the Jest test suite.
