# Watch Mode & Hot Reload

This feature enables an efficient development workflow with automatic recompilation and extension reloading on file changes.

## Instructions

1.  Configure a `watch` script in `package.json` to run the TypeScript compiler in watch mode (`tsc -w`).
2.  Set up the VS Code launch configuration (`launch.json`) to run the extension in a new development host window.
3.  Ensure that changes made in watch mode are automatically picked up and reloaded in the extension development host.
