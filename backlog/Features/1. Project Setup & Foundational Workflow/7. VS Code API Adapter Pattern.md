# VS Code API Adapter Pattern

This feature implements the Adapter pattern to isolate business logic from the VS Code API, improving testability.

## Instructions

1.  Define interfaces in the `src/core/` module for any external services the application needs (e.g., file system access, showing notifications).
2.  Implement concrete adapter classes in `src/adapters/` that implement these interfaces using the `vscode` API.
3.  Use dependency injection to provide the core logic with the adapter implementations at runtime.
