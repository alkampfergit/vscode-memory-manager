# Two-Tier Testing Strategy

This feature establishes a comprehensive testing strategy with two distinct levels of testing.

## Instructions

1.  **Feature-Level Tests**: Write unit tests for individual functions and classes within the `src/core/` and `src/adapters/` modules. Place these tests in `tests/` with a mirrored directory structure.
2.  **Module Integration Tests**: Write tests that verify the collaboration between different modules to accomplish a complete feature (e.g., parsing a file and updating the index).
3.  Ensure both types of tests are run by the `npm test` command.
