# Memory Synchronization âœ…

This feature ensures the in-memory index is kept up-to-date with changes on the file system.

**Status:** Completed - Implemented in [MemorySynchronizationService.ts](../../../src/core/MemorySynchronizationService.ts)

## Instructions

1.  Create a `MemorySynchronizationService` that handles file system events.
2.  When a file is created or changed, the service should read the file, parse it, and update its entry in the in-memory index.
3.  When a file is deleted, the service should remove its corresponding entry from the index.
4.  This service will be triggered by the File Watcher System.
