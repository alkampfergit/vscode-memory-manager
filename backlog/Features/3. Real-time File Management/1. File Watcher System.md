# File Watcher System âœ…

This feature implements a system to monitor the `Memory/` folder for any changes to files.

**Status:** Completed - Implemented in [FileWatcherSystem.ts](../../../src/core/FileWatcherSystem.ts)

## Instructions

1.  Use the `vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher` API to create a watcher for files in the `Memory/` directory.
2.  The watcher should monitor for file creation, changes, and deletions (`onDidCreate`, `onDidChange`, `onDidDelete`).
3.  The glob pattern for the watcher should target markdown files within the `Memory/` folder (e.g., `**/Memory/**/*.md`).
4.  When a file event is triggered, the handler should delegate the file path to the memory synchronization system.
