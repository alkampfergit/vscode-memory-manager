# Primary Testing Focus (File Watcher Integration) âœ…

This feature focuses on testing the integration between the file watcher and the memory index.

**Status:** Completed - Tests in [file-watcher-integration.test.ts](../../../tests/integration/file-watcher-integration.test.ts)

## Instructions

1.  Write integration tests that simulate file system events.
2.  Create a test that simulates creating a new valid memory file and verify it gets added to the index.
3.  Create a test that simulates updating an existing memory file and verify the index is updated.
4.  Create a test that simulates deleting a memory file and verify it is removed from the index.
5.  Create a test that simulates correcting a malformed file and verify it gets added to the index.
