# Silent Recovery

This feature allows the system to automatically re-index a file when it is corrected after being in an invalid state.

## Instructions

1.  When the file watcher detects a change to a previously malformed file, the `refreshFile` logic should be triggered.
2.  If the file is now valid, the parser should succeed, and the file should be added or updated in the memory index.
3.  Any error indicators associated with the file (e.g., in the Problems Panel) should be cleared.
4.  The process should be automatic, requiring no manual intervention from the user.
