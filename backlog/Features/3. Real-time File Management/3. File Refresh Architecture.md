# File Refresh Architecture âœ…

This feature defines a method for refreshing individual files in the memory index.

**Status:** Completed - Implemented in [MemorySynchronizationService.ts](../../../src/core/MemorySynchronizationService.ts)

## Instructions

1.  Implement a public method on the `MemoryIndex` or a related service, such as `refreshFile(filePath: string)`.
2.  This method will encapsulate the logic to read, parse, and update a single file in the cache.
3.  If the file no longer exists or is invalid, it should be removed from the index.
4.  This method will be called by the memory synchronization logic in response to file watcher events.
