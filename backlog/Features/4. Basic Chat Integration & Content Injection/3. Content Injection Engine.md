# Content Injection Engine

This feature is responsible for retrieving memory content based on a tag and preparing it for injection into the chat.

## Instructions

1.  Create a `ContentInjectionEngine` class.
2.  Implement a method that takes a tag pattern as input.
3.  This method should query the `MemoryIndex` using the hierarchical tag system to find all matching file paths.
4.  For each matching file path, retrieve the full memory item (content and metadata) from the index.
5.  For this basic version, concatenate the content of all matching files into a single string.
6.  This content will be added to the chat context.
