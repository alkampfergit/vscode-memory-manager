# Content Injection Engine

This feature is responsible for retrieving memory content based on a tag and injecting it into the Copilot Chat context.

## Instructions

1.  Create a `ContentInjectionEngine` class.
2.  Implement a method that takes a tag pattern as input.
3.  This method should query the `MemoryIndex` using the hierarchical tag system to find all matching file paths.
4.  For each matching file path, retrieve the file URI.
5.  Use the VS Code command `github.copilot.chat.attachFile` to attach all matching memory files to the chat context:
    ```typescript
    await vscode.commands.executeCommand(
        'github.copilot.chat.attachFile',
        ...fileUris  // Spread array of file URIs
    );
    ```
6.  The attached files will automatically be included in Copilot's context when processing the user's prompt.
7.  Return the list of attached file paths for logging/debugging purposes.

## Technical Notes

- **Method**: Use `vscode.commands.executeCommand('github.copilot.chat.attachFile', ...uris)` for reliable file attachment
- **File Format**: Memory files are already in markdown format, which Copilot can parse directly
- **No Manual Concatenation**: VS Code handles content injection automatically
- **Multiple Files**: The command accepts multiple URIs as separate arguments
