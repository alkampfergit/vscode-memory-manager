# MVP: #memory-tag Command

This feature implements the minimum viable product for the `#memory-tag` command.

## Instructions

1.  Connect the command router to the content injection engine.
2.  When a user types `#memory-tag <tag>` on the first line, the router extracts `<tag>`.
3.  The injection engine finds all memory files with that tag.
4.  The injection engine attaches all matching memory files to the chat context using `github.copilot.chat.attachFile`.
5.  The extension extracts everything except the first line as the actual user prompt.
6.  The extension allows Copilot to process the user prompt with the attached memory files as context.
7.  For the MVP, this does not need to handle link resolution or complex queries.

## Workflow Example

**User Types:**
```
#memory-tag backend.database
How do I optimize connection pool settings?
```

**Extension Processing:**
1. Parses first line: tag = `backend.database`
2. Finds 3 memory files with tag `backend.database`
3. Attaches all 3 files using `github.copilot.chat.attachFile`
4. Extracts prompt: `How do I optimize connection pool settings?`
5. Lets Copilot process the prompt with attached memory context
