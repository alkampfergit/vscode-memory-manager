# MVP: #memory-tag Command

This feature implements the minimum viable product for the `#memory-tag` command.

## Instructions

1.  Connect the command router to the content injection engine.
2.  When a user types `#memory-tag <tag>`, the router extracts `<tag>`.
3.  The injection engine finds all memories with that tag.
4.  The concatenated content of the found memories is added to the Copilot prompt context.
5.  For the MVP, this does not need to handle link resolution or complex queries.
