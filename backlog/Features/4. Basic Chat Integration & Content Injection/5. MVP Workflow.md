# MVP: Manual Memory Creation

This feature describes the user workflow for creating memories in the initial version of the extension.

## Instructions

1.  Document the process for the user: manually create a `.md` file inside the `Memory/` directory.
2.  Instruct the user to add the required YAML frontmatter (`title`, `tags`).
3.  Inform the user that once the file is saved, the extension will automatically detect and index it.
4.  The new tags will then become available for querying via `#memory-tag`.
