# Copilot Chat Participant Integration

This feature registers the extension as a participant in Copilot Chat to handle custom commands.

## Instructions

1.  In the `extension.ts` activate function, use `vscode.chat.createChatParticipant` to register a new participant.
2.  The participant's ID should be unique, e.g., `memory.manager`.
3.  The participant's handler will be invoked for every chat request.
4.  Inside the handler, check if the `request.command` is `memory-tag`.
