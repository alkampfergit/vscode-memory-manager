# Command Router for #memory-tag

This feature implements the logic to parse and handle the `#memory-tag` command from the user.

## Instructions

1.  In the chat participant handler, check if the prompt begins with `#memory-tag`.
2.  If it does, split the prompt into lines.
3.  Parse **only the first line** to extract the tag pattern the user is querying for:
    - Remove the `#memory-tag` prefix from the first line.
    - Trim any leading/trailing whitespace from the tag pattern.
4.  Extract everything **except the first line** as the actual user prompt that will be passed to Copilot.
5.  Pass the extracted tag pattern to the content injection engine to find matching memory files.
6.  This logic should be inside the `if (request.command === 'memory-tag')` block.

## Example Prompt Parsing

**User Input:**
```
#memory-tag backend.database
How do I implement connection pooling for high-traffic scenarios?
```

**Parsed Result:**
- Tag Pattern: `backend.database`
- User Prompt: `How do I implement connection pooling for high-traffic scenarios?`
