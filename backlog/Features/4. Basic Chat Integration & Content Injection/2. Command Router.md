# Command Router for #memory-tag

This feature implements the logic to parse and handle the `#memory-tag` command from the user.

## Instructions

1.  In the chat participant handler, check if the prompt begins with `#memory-tag`.
2.  If it does, parse the rest of the prompt to extract the tag pattern the user is querying for.
3.  Trim any leading/trailing whitespace from the tag pattern.
4.  Pass the extracted tag pattern to the content injection engine.
5.  This logic should be inside the `if (request.command === 'memory-tag')` block.
