# Build and Use the Add-in

You will need to create a README.md file and a series of guide on how to build and use the addin. This file contains the basic information that are needed to test the addin locally.

Ensure that we have script to build the extension in place.

## Prerequisites

You need to have `vsce` (Visual Studio Code Extensions) installed globally. If you don't have it, you can install it using npm:

```bash
npm install -g vsce
```

## Building the Extension

1.  Open a terminal in the root of the project.
2.  Run the packaging command. This will bundle the extension into a `.vsix` file.

    A script should be available in `package.json` to do this. For example:
    ```bash
    npm run package
    ```
    If not, you can run `vsce` directly:
    ```bash
    vsce package
    ```

    This will create a file like `vscode-memory-manager-x.x.x.vsix` in the project's root directory.

## Installing the Extension in VS Code

1.  Open Visual Studio Code.
2.  Go to the **Extensions** view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3.  Click on the **...** (More Actions) menu at the top of the Extensions view.
4.  Select **Install from VSIX...**.
5.  In the file dialog, navigate to the project root, select the `.vsix` file you just created, and click **Install**.
6.  After installation, VS Code will prompt you to reload the window. Click **Reload Now** to activate the extension.

## Using the Extension

Once reloaded, the Memory Manager extension will be active. You can start using it in the Copilot Chat view. For example, try typing `#memory-tag ` to see if tag completion appears.
