# Usage Hints (File Counts)

This feature adds extra information to the completion items to show how many memory files are associated with each tag.

## Instructions

1.  When creating `CompletionItem` objects for tags, use the `detail` property to display the file count.
2.  The `MemoryIndex` should provide a way to get the number of files for a given tag.
3.  The completion item's detail text could look like `(3 memories)`.
4.  This helps the user understand the scope of each tag before selecting it.
