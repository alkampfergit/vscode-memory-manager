# Fuzzy Matching for Tag Suggestions

This feature improves the tag suggestion experience by allowing for partial and inexact matches.

## Instructions

1.  When filtering tags for autocompletion, implement a fuzzy matching algorithm instead of a simple `startsWith` check.
2.  For example, typing `post` should match `backend.database.postgres`.
3.  A simple approach is to check if the characters of the query appear in the tag in the correct order.
4.  More advanced libraries for fuzzy matching can be considered if needed.
5.  Rank the fuzzy-matched results based on how closely they match the query.
