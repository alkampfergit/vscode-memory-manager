# Wildcard Preview in Completions

This feature adds a completion item to show the user they can use a wildcard to select all subtags.

## Instructions

1.  When a user types a partial hierarchical tag (e.g., `backend.`), add a special completion item for the wildcard.
2.  The completion item's label should be something like `* (All backend tags)`.
3.  The `insertText` for this item should be `*`.
4.  This provides a discoverable way for users to learn about and use the wildcard query feature.
