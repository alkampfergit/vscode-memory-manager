# Recent Tags Prioritization

This feature improves the relevance of tag suggestions by prioritizing recently used tags.

## Instructions

1.  Implement a mechanism to track recently used tags (e.g., a simple array or a more sophisticated LRU cache).
2.  When a user successfully executes a `#memory-tag` command, add the tag to the recents list.
3.  When providing completion items, check if a tag is in the recents list.
4.  Use the `sortText` property of `CompletionItem` to give recent tags a higher priority, causing them to appear at the top of the list.
