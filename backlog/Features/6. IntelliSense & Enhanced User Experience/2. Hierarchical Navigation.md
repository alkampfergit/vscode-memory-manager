# Hierarchical Navigation in Completions

This feature enhances tag autocompletion to support navigation of hierarchical tags.

## Instructions

1.  When providing completion items, if the user has typed a partial tag ending in a dot (e.g., `backend.`), filter the suggestions to only show the next level of subtags.
2.  For `backend.`, suggestions would include `database` and `auth`.
3.  The completion item's `insertText` should be just the next part of the tag (e.g., `database`), not the full path.
4.  The `filterText` should be the full tag path to allow for continued filtering.
