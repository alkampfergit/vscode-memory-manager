# Content Processing: Sizing and Separators

This feature defines the rules for how final content is assembled, ensuring it's clean and user-controlled.

## Instructions

1.  When concatenating content from multiple memory files, ensure they are joined by a simple double newline (`\n\n`).
2.  Do not add any automatic separators, headers, or metadata into the injected content block.
3.  Do not implement any truncation or size limits. The user is responsible for the size of their memory files.
4.  The goal is a seamless block of text that feels like a single, cohesive piece of context for Copilot.
