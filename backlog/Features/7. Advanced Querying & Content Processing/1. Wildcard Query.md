# Query Patterns: Wildcard Match

This feature extends the query engine to support wildcard matching for hierarchical tags.

## Instructions

1.  Modify the tag query logic in the `MemoryIndex` or `HierarchicalTagSystem`.
2.  If a query pattern ends with `.*` (e.g., `backend.*`), it should match all tags that start with `backend.`.
3.  The query should return a flattened list of all files associated with any of the matched subtags.
4.  Ensure no duplicate files are returned if a file has multiple matching tags.
